3.Executing program
How to Launch the Software and Install Requirements

copy the code, then npm install
Assemble the agreement:

If you're using Hardhat, copy the truffle code and compile it.

Sh
Copy the npx hardhat compilation code.
Release the contract into a regional blockchain, such as Ganache:

If use Hardhat, copy the truffle code and migrate it.
sh Copy code npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --localhost on the network

Engage with the agreement:You can interact directly through your front-end application or use a tool like Truffle Console.

4.Help
Typical Issues and Problems:
compilation mistakes Verify that the Solidity version you have corresponds with the pragma declaration (pragma solidity 0.8.18;).
